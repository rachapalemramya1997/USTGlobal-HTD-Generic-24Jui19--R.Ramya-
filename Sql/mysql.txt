JOINS
*****************************************
multiple of table at the same time is known as joins


******************************************

select * from Tablename

#select a table from database and put under execution 
we can pass table name as an argument
#it is used to select coloumns or an expresions from the table which is under execution and it is 
also responsible to execute the result set


* select all the information

first from will execute and select will execute

SQL CLAUSES
***********************************
SQL consists of multiple clauses
=>is class is subprogram which can accept arguments
WHERE CLAUSE
****************
=> the where clause is used to filter records.
=> the where clause is used to extract only those recordes that fulfill a specified condition.
WHERE syntax:
Select column1,columm2,..........From table_name
where condition;


select * from Customers
where country = 'Mexico';
 it extract the table from {1}
where condition{2}
select{3}

<>WAQ to display id , name from the table?

DELETE
********************************
to delete the perticular record synrtax is
delete from student_info where id=256;

TRUNCATE
*************************888
if we want to delete all the data from the table we will go to truncate command
if we want to delete perticular record we go for delete.
if we want to delete the structure and records of the table then we will go to "DROP"
