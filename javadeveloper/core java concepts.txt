=>Java is object oriented programming language.
=>Java is strong type language.
=>Java is very easy to learn.
=>Java is platform independent.
=>Java has lot of methods.
**********
versions of java:
=>Java standard edision - it is for stand alone application
=>Java micro edision - it is used for small devices
=>Java enterprise edition - we develop an application it is used for a business or organisation
***********
JRE =>java runtime environent
it acts as a interpreter between source and class files
=>it converts source code into byte code and converts byte code to class or output.
************
OBJECT:
=>object is a group of variables and methods.
=>in java every entity is treated as object
=>an object is a entity which has some states and behaviour.
method:
=>method is a set of statements written for a particular task.
=>method create once and call n no of times.
************
Keywords:
These are words which are predefined meanings.It is present inside a programming language.
=>java has 50 / 53(3 literals)  keywords are present.
**************
Identifiers:
Identifiers are names given to a components or elements of a program.
=>Rules:
1.It should always start with an alphabet or a letter.
2.It is not starting with with a digit but we can add n no of digits after a first character or a letter.
3.Identifiers are case sensitive.
4.All the 53 keywords are not identifiers.
5.only (_,$) special characters are allowed.
*****************
VARIABLES:
=>variable is a small memory space which stores some values.
=>We can stores some values and some data'
=>Each and every variable must have some data.
=>it is temporary.
***************
Data Type:
=>It specifies the type of data that will store in a memory.
=>Two Types:
 1.Primitive datatype
 2.Reference datatype
1.Primitive datatype:
==> Eight types:
1.Byte: It consists of 1byte or 8bits .  This range is -128 to 127.
2.Short: It consists of 2byte or 16bits. This range is  -32768 to 32767.
3.Int:  It consists of 4byte or 32bits.
4.Long:  It consists of 8byte or 64bits.
5.double:  It consists of 4byte or 32bits. //it is used for decimal values
6.Float:  It consists of 8byte or 64bits.    //it is used for decimal values
************
 VARIABLES:
=>usage 
datatype var;                         //declaration
var = value;                            //initilisation
system.out.println(var);    //utilization
